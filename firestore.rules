/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for Y-Ultimate Pulse.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset prioritizes a secure, owner-based access control model for user data,
 * combined with public read access and restricted write access for events and venues.
 * Authorization decisions are made independently at each level of the hierarchy.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores individual user profiles, accessible only to the user themselves.
 * - /events/{eventId}: Stores event information, publicly readable but writable only by the organizer or an admin (not yet implemented).
 * - /venues/{venueId}: Stores venue information, publicly readable, with write access potentially restricted to admins (not yet implemented).
 * - /organizations/{organizationId}: Stores organization data. Can be created by any signed-in user, but only managed by its members.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User listing is disallowed to protect privacy.
 * - Events and Venues are publicly readable to facilitate discovery.
 * - Default security posture for ambiguous relationships is strict owner-only access.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - Events: The `organizerId` field within each event document is used to quickly verify ownership for updates and deletes, avoiding costly `get()` operations.
 * - Organizations: The `organizers` array within each document is used to verify management permissions.
